3. P - Proportional "Immediate" Correction

"proportional" correction

"The farther off you are, the bigger
correction you make, i.e. proportional."

>
4. I - Integral "Over Time" Correction

"steady state" correction

"Have we been failing to make progress
correcting?  Add a little bit more correction."
