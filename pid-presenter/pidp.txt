2. P - Proportional
    "Immediate" Correction





"The farther off you are,
the bigger correction you make
(i.e. proportional)."

>
3. I - Integral
    "Over Time" Correction


"steady state" correction


"Have we been failing to make
progress? Add a little bit
more correction."
>
4. D - Derivative
    "Take It Easy" Correction

"Is our correction going too fast?
Slow it down (dampen it) a bit."

>
4. PID Values ("Coefficients")
    and tuning
